# Oxford MindMap Client

This is an Expo app, so it requires Expo to publish and to run dev builds.

First install `nodejs` and `npm`, its dependencies. Using the package manager is least likely to cause issues. It was developed on `nodejs` version v12.18.3 and `npm` version 6.14.8.

You will need the Expo CLI tool, which is annoying to install non-globally. A good way to avoid running `npm` as root is changing its default directory, like shown [https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally](here).

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli

cd client/
npm install
npm start
```

This installs all dependencies and launches the Expo server, which serves "app bundles" to phones and web (note that web is not supported mostly because of `react-native-elements`, although by now probably because of more reasons).

To run the app on a mobile device you need the Expo mobile app. Use it to scan the QR code printed to console to connect to the server (over LAN, although other options are available) and download the app bundle, which will launch the app.

Shaking the phone (at least on Android) displays a debugging menu. The server prints the messages generated by `console.log` inside the app to its terminal.
